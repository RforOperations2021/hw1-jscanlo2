### Homework 1: Voting Rights and Voting Policies

This web app uses data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. The data is derived from their "Election Administration and Voting Survey" (EAVS), which is conducted every two years. This app utilizes the most recent survey data available, which covers the time period from 2016 to 2018.

The app aims to deliver a comprehensive overview and comparison of various voting and election policies across the U.S., including topics like registration (automatic, online, same-day), registration invalidation and voter purging, felony disenfranchisement, and voter identification laws.
